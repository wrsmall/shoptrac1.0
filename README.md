   <h5>&nbsp; Picture this. You have dropped your vehicle off at your favorite auto shop. Several hours have passed, and due to your busy schedule you are starting to get antsy. You decide to call the shop in order to get an update on your vehcle, and are greated over the phone by the shop manager, only to be put on hold while he/she has to walk out into the shop to get a status on your vehicle. This is where Shoptrac1.0 comes in! With the integration of Shoptrac1.0 the manager no longer has to put you the customer on hold and instead can deliver and immediate answer on the status of your vehicle.<h5/>
